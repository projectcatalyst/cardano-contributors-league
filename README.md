# Overview

Catalyst contributors are community members who are paid by the Cardano treasury to work full time to help to manage, support and improve the Catalyst ecosystem. The Catalyst ecosystem governs the distribution of the Cardano treasury. Contributors help in a multitude of areas such as infrastructure and tooling, supporting the community, improving processes and supporting proposals being submitted into the funding process.

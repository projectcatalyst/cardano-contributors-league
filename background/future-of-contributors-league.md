# Future of Contributors League

## Problems

Some key issues were identified with funding contributors as a funding approach and working structure:

* **Clarity** - There is a risk of a lack of clarity on exactly what the contributors would be working on which makes it more difficult to gage whether there will be a good return on intention for a cohort of contributors.
* **Team synergy** - There is a risk that contributors paid for by the treasury don't have a high synergy when working with each other. Contributors may prefer different processes or approaches to other contributors which may lead to decision complexity or potential conflicts.
* **Selecting candidates** - Voters are likely to have much familiarity with the candidates they are voting for to become contributors. A proposal is easier to understand from a high level than working out the potential impact of each contributor. Ranking candidates between others without sufficient information is also difficult.

## **Solutions**

**Usage of focus areas and minimum thresholds**

[Focus areas](../contributors-league/focus-areas/) such as development, coordination, analysis, product and design are used help with clarity for voters other contributors. Contributors can define a focus area so that it is clear where they intend to be focussing the majority of their time whilst contributing in the ecosystem. This can be mixed with having minimum thresholds for certain focus areas so there is enough capacity in each areas for the cohort to function effectively and support the ecosystem.

**Clear and open product development workflow**

The product development workflow that the contributors use to improve and maintain the ecosystem will need to be open source and easily viewable by the community. A well defined process followed by contributors will help with both the potential issues of team synergy and clarity.&#x20;

****

**Fund a DAO instead of contributors individually**

Selecting candidates is a very specific task for the general voters to be expected to vote on. Over time DAO tooling can be created to move from funding contributors into funding a DAO that will have enough functionality to be managed by the community and used by the contributors. As one improvement having engaged community members vote for who becomes a full time contributor would make more sense than general voters. General voters are best used to vote for the general direction and focuses of the core ecosystem that contributors would then spend their time on.

## Future opportunities

Many of the following could also be applied to proposals from smaller teams setups but they would need to have the same tools and processes.&#x20;

****

**Community governance**

* Through the usage of Atala PRISM the contributors and engaged community can create governance systems for each key part required for a DAO to function. For Catalyst this could mean having governance for voting on who is hired and paid by the DAO by community members who have proof of engagement in the process (e.g. been a community advisor, funded proposer etc).
* Contributors and engaged community members could also use simple voting systems to decide on key decisions for improving core parts of the ecosystem such as prioritising problems, picking solution implementations and allocating funds across the core parts of the ecosystem.

**Bonuses**

* The initial suggestion for contributors is to fund them based on them selecting their seniority that is on a budget range for that focus area. Bonuses can be introduced to reward high impact work from contributors. The purpose of this is it will help align incentives so contributors are paid a fair salary but have the incentive to go above and beyond to receive further funding if they want to. Community governance could be involved in the decisions when those bonus funds are distributed.

**Tasks for part time contributors**

* The contributors or engaged community members can set up high impact tasks with funding to help maintain or improve the ecosystem. Funds offered for specific tasks could offer a great way for newcomers to the community to get involved more passively with the ecosystem and build up the knowledge needed to make the next leap such as become a full time paid contributor or join a project team. The ecosystem will benefit from providing both low and high commitment paths where contributors get paid to build up ecosystem knowledge and skills.

# Funding Approaches and Work Structure Comparisons

## Proposals

The proposal process consists of individuals or teams creating proposal documents that detail out a solution to a defined problem. A proposal will include what they are trying to achieve, a roadmap, budget, team, success metrics and how it's audited. Project Catalyst has up until fund 7 solely used proposal based funding.

### **Issues**

**Poor alignment**

* **Misaligned financial incentives** - Proposal teams have a financial incentive to defend proposals they create as them being funding can be what determines whether they get to spend time working in the ecosystem. This financial incentive can prevent proposal teams moving to the strongest solution ideas and to instead continue to support and promote what they have initially proposed.
* **Misaligned collaboration incentives** - If proposers help other proposal teams when they have existing funded proposals to complete they risk not completing them or missing out on future funding rounds. There is no direct incentive based on how they were funded for a proposal to collaborate with other similar proposals, within the current model with a similar idea they would instead be competing.
* **Diverging processes and implementation approaches** - Proposal teams making solutions for the core ecosystem currently have no incentive to standardise implementation approaches and converge on their processes and execution. In terms of technical implementation this lack of incentive can lead to multiple different frontend and backend frameworks or databases and protocols being used that will make the ecosystem more complex to work within and can eventually lead to slowing down innovation.
* **Emotional based implications** - Writing a proposal takes at least a moderate amount of time and investment. Proposal teams will have a closer attachment to something the more they've worked on it and more so when proposals are attached to whether they are going to receive funding or not. Abandoning a proposal can feel more like a loss when funding is tied to proposal ideas rather than them being funded as a skilled individual. Proposals promote the importance of your own ideas and proposals to get funding over collaborating on what the actual best solution might be. Similar proposal ideas also have increased emotional implications as providing feedback to the other team is more complex when those proposals are directly tied to whether each proposal team will receive funding.

**Less flexibility**

* **Solution flexibility** - People are more confined to the proposals they get funded by as that becomes their obligation to the community. This is instead of them having flexibility to focus on the highest impact solution at a given moment. A simple example could be in Catalyst where a proposal tool doesn't need much work for improvement however there is a lot of work to do on a community advisor tool. A proposal team funded for the proposal tool have no incentive to abandon their own project in the short term to help where help is most needed.
* **Changing ecosystem requirements** - The ecosystem can change very rapidly which makes proposal based funding a risk due to it being focussed on solutions to a defined problem rather than having a team that is flexible to changing requirements that can adjust or abandon tools and processes that are no longer relevant. Any time a proposal based team does this change they would need to justify it to the community which slows their speed to adapt and manoeuvre.&#x20;
* **Increased difficulty in pivoting** - When a proposal is funded the proposal team have been funded to implement a specified solution. If the proposal team determines later their initial proposal is not a good approach then the team will need to justify a change of focus to the community. These implications take time to plan and communicate.

**Knowledge gaps**

* **Proposer** - Smaller proposal teams focussing on a single solution have an increased likelihood of being unaware of other ecosystem problems if they are not collaborating and communicating with the other teams involved. As well as this having separated teams may not have the same depth of skills to suggest all the potential solutions nor choose the best solution from them. Issues around effective problem sensing, problem prioritisation, solution research and solution selection become increasingly likely without high collaboration and synergy between the core ecosystem community.
* **Community advisor** - An advisor is not incentivised to research, analyse and be up to date with the problems of the ecosystem and the potential solutions that could resolve them. Without this incentive it becomes likely that an advisor doesn't have enough information to fully review what the impact of a proposal could be without the full information and time to reflect on it. This leads to more of a limited assessment quality from the majority of community advisors due to the practicalities of not being able to cover the depth of information required.
* **Voter** - The majority of voters won't be as involved as the core members of the ecosystem nor potentially have the time to understand all the problems and potential solutions to make a fully informed opinion on which proposals are most high impact. Voters that fully trust community advisor reviews result in the potential knowledge gap issues from the advisors.

**Slower execution speed**

* **Proposal writing** - For most small to large changes within the core ecosystem a proposal would need to be created to fund the execution. For many proposals adding milestones, KPI and audit processes may be too much required information for what might be a simple or small change. Proposal writing along with adding in depth information as a requirement increases complexity and reduces execution speed.
* **Slow governance process** - Core ecosystem community contributors have to wait for the governance process to finish for them to be funded to complete tasks. The core ecosystem requires rapid iteration and the current process hinders execution speed.

**Complexity**

* **Budget inaccuracies** - It is difficult to predict exactly how long it will take for a team to execute a proposal. The complexity is further increased by adding in the need for budgeting tax or the process of measuring success with KPIs. Trying to predict these budgets with any exactness adds complexity which could be avoided by paying contributors a salary budget.
* **Scattered funding** - Each proposal receives funding for its execution which leads to complexity as community members must calculate what they should be paid by an increasing amount of funded proposals they are helping with.
* **Increased tax implications** - Funding a proposal means that a group of people who represent some form of entity will get paid before the contributors are. This leads to tax considerations where in many countries this may be considered an initial taxable event (e.g. corporation or sales tax) that should be applied before funding is then passed down onto contributors.
* &#x20;**Detailed proposal information** - Proposals must add detailed proposal information such as a roadmap, KPIs and similar details which adds complexity to the process especially in scenarios where work that needs to happen within the core ecosystem is more simple and doesn't require the same depth of information.

### **Advantages**

* **Clarity** - Proposals offer full clarity to the whole community on the more exact solution that will be implemented. This approach is great for whose who are highly involved and want to interact and collaborate on that process
* **Detailed plan** - Proposals provide a way for teams to provide a detailed plan for how something will be achieved and why it is being implemented.
* **Fully researched** - Proposals can provide as much research as needed to justify why a solution is the correct approach. This approach is great for community members highly involved who want to understand the full background behind a proposal.

## Catalyst Circles

The initial Catalyst Circle was created to help with identifying the problems that exist in the ecosystem and to help decide which ones were high priority. Once prioritised the circle would look at potential solution options and also communicate these problems back to the community for either circle members to look into resolving or the community.

### **Issues**

**Lower commitment** - Catalyst circle members do not need to work in the ecosystem full time which limits the value they can provide as there is no guarantee towards where they spend the remainder of their time. This lower commitment also brings in the potential issue of member knowledge gaps as there is no guarantee they are spending sufficient time in the ecosystem.

**Limited outcomes and execution** - The circle often does not deal with implementation details and due to its structure would also practically not be a good team to execute solutions.

**Complexity** - Catalyst Circles are funded by proposals which results in the same complexities that are detailed under the proposal issues which include scattered funding, budget inaccuracies and detailed proposal information.&#x20;

### **Advantages**

**Supports a product development workflow** - The circle has helped add some structure to the process of identifying problems through to suggesting solutions which helps to bring the community together on building solutions. Unfortunately the benefit stops at the solution suggestions stage as this is where proposals must come in to fill the gaps which have the issues which have been detailed under proposals.

**Transparent** - All meetings and information around circle meetings is recorded and public to the community

**Community voted** - The community democratically votes on who is elected into the circle&#x20;

**Flexible** - The circle members can move their attention onto other concerns quickly that helps them maximise their impact

## Rapid funding

### Issues

**Proposal structure** - By using a proposal structure any rapid funding approach gets similar issues as outlined under proposals. The issues around poor alignment, flexibility, knowledge gaps and complexity will often still apply though simply on a smaller scale due to rapid funding being used as a tool for funding smaller requests.

**Governance complexity** - Rapid funding still requires governance on who will receive the funding. Community voter engagement for the larger more substantial proposals is still difficult to increase. Having even smaller and regular proposals would have a greater issue.

### Advantages

**Speed** - Rapid funding can help community members working on the core ecosystem innovate faster by not needing to go through a slower more detailed process.

**Simple process** - Community members can save time and effort by using a simple process to get smaller amounts of funding rather than go through the current proposal process.

## Contributors

### **Issues**

**Clarity** - There is a risk of a lack of clarity on exactly what the contributors would be working on which makes it more difficult to gage whether there will be a good return on intention for a cohort of contributors.

**Team synergy** - There is a risk that contributors paid for by the treasury don't have a high synergy when working with each other. Contributors may prefer different processes or approaches to other contributors which may lead to decision complexity or potential conflicts.

**Selecting candidates** - Voters are likely to have much familiarity with the candidates they are voting for to become contributors. A proposal is easier to understand from a high level than working out the potential impact of each contributor. Ranking candidates between others without sufficient information is also difficult.

### **Avantages**

**Flexibility**

* **Solution flexibility** - Contributors can move instantly between different solutions in the ecosystem that have higher demands or provide a better return on intention. The contributor can focus on what solution at that moment provides the most impact.&#x20;
* **Ecosystem changes** - If the requirements of the ecosystem changes then contributors can make sudden changes to tools or processes to accommodate them. Contributors aren't tied to solutions for funding meaning they become far easier to discard.
* **Working preferences** - Contributors have the objective with providing the most impact they can within the ecosystem. For many contributors this may mean the use of a single skill they enjoy the most across the entire ecosystem or for other contributors using multiple skills within a single area. Contributors would have more flexibility to work exactly as they want.

**Aligned incentives**

* **Align implementation approaches** - A group of contributors voting on implementation approaches instead of small team will help push implementations towards consistency rather than divergence. This results in easier integration between all tools and processes and any onboarding of future contributors.
* **High impact tasks** - By funding contributors instead of proposals the contributors are able to identity any high impact task that is not currently compensated. For example a high impact task could be to provide more feedback to proposals who submit a proposal before any assessment stage that could lead to a far higher quality set of proposals in each funding round. Funding contributors to maximise return on intention have an incentive to find high impact tasks that benefit the ecosystem the most.

**Maximised collaboration**

* **Better ecosystem collaboration** - By funding contributors the focus then becomes on maximising the impact of their contributions rather than backing a single or a few ideas. Contributors are incentivised to involve themselves in any of the core ecosystem parts where they would provide the most value. This approach means contributors share their most impactful knowledge and skills across the ecosystem in a way that motivates them the most but also provides the most value.
* **Aligning proposal teams** - Contributors with an objective to maximise return on intention have an incentive to help bring proposal teams together and look for ways they could collaborate or reduce duplicated efforts. Contributors become a glue within the ecosystem that brings everyone together.
* **Introduction to project teams** - Contributors can get introduced and work with existing project teams outside the core ecosystem whilst providing support. This interaction can lead to finding people who would be a good fit to join and support those proposals which could be a friend they know or even themselves once they finish being a contributor.

**Simplicity**

* **Simple objective** - Contributors have the objective to provide the best return on intention they can through high impact work that helps maintain, support or improve the core ecosystem.
* **Less distractions** - Impactful contributors in the ecosystem can be best utilised by doing what they do best rather than needing to create proposals and market them to get funding. By funding individuals in the ecosystem the community can benefit from the contributors being able to focus undistracted on whatever is most impactful.
* **Simple tax implications** - Funding individual contributors allows them to class that as personal income or through their own personal business entity. This simplifies the tax implications and saves time meaning contributors have more time to focus on impact.

**Better community support**

* **Effective community support** - Funded contributors league candidates would be able to become a better nucleus of support for the community and help with answering questions and technical issues as they become increasingly familiar with the entire ecosystem.
* **Supports proposals** - Contributors are incentivised to support Catalyst focussed proposals and help where possible. Encourages innovation outside the team whilst maximising on collaboration.
* **Increased education** - More full time contributors helps produce people who are fully educated on the entire ecosystem due to more involvement. This increased awareness and experience leads to being able to support the community better and improve coordination and collaboration.

## **Summary**

* Proposal based funding has a number of issues when it is used for maintaining and improving the core Cardano ecosystem. The process is not flexible, adds complexity and misaligns community incentives, has slower execution speed and many stakeholders can have knowledge gaps.
* Catalyst Circles help to provide better guidance and support for the initial stages of a product development workflow by helping with the problem sensing and prioritisation and also research on solution options to present to the community. Where it falls short though is solutions are not implemented by circle members and instead would go through the proposal process. Funding circles also adds complexity and members would be more knowledgable and useful to help with executing solutions if they could instead work full time as a contributor.
* Rapid funding is being explored to help resolve the issues around the speed and simplicity of the process. Although more convenient the process still is in a proposal structure meaning it does not resolve the issues of full alignment and flexibility of community efforts.
* The contributors approach brings together advantages from all of the options with little downside. It brings the product development workflow structure that Catalyst Circle introduced but contributors can then start taking a solution through to implementation as well that further enhances their knowledge and the iterative feedback loop. Contributors can use the same open transparent process to host meetings to involve the community and provide the same benefits. Contributors also has the benefits of speed and simplicity that the rapid funding approach is looking to resolve but doesn't have the drawbacks of not solving the alignment and collaboration issues.
* The core reason using contributors provides a better approach to building out core ecosystem features such Project Catalyst are it maximises alignment and collaboration and gives maximum flexibility for contributors to provide the highest possible impact.
* The issues for using contributors can also be resolved either by product development workflow considerations or slightly changing how funding is received. These issues and any opportunities are covered in the [future of contributors league](future-of-contributors-league.md).

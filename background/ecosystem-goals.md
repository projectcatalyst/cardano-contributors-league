  Details of key goals that make sense for core parts of the Cardano ecosystem
  starting with Project Catalyst

# Ecosystem Goals

Each different part of the Cardano ecosystem can have goals to strive towards that help maximise its impact. Project Catalyst is a core part of Cardano where the responsibility of maintaining and improving this part of the ecosystem has started being pushed towards the community. With this in mind we can list sensible goals for Project Catalyst and the type of environment that would be needed to help reach those goals.

## **Project Catalyst**

[Project Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com) is an example of a core part of the Cardano ecosystem that is important for the overall growth and success of the ecosystem.



**Experience objectives** - What goals are sensible that if achieved would help Project Catalyst reach its full potential?

_The following list provides some example goals however is a non-exhaustive list._

* **High quality end user experience** - As an ecosystem we want the different users (voters, community advisors, proposers) of the ecosystem to have a high quality experience that represents a world leading ecosystem. The better the experience the more high quality contributors and people the ecosystem can attract.
* **Easy to understand and get involved** - The ecosystem needs to be easy for people to learn and use so that the largest amount of the global population are able to benefit from using Cardano.
* **Make it easy for the community to be contributors** - The ecosystem will benefit from making it easier for contributors to help across the whole ecosystem by having clear skills and approaches that have been used for its implementation. If the ecosystem has an ever increasing amount of implementation styles and approaches the complexity of contributing to the ecosystem increases over time and would make it harder for people to get involved.

**Core system flow**

The core system flow for Project Catalyst starts with proposal creation and ends with funded proposals reporting their progress and KPIs whilst executing their proposal. The flow involves multiple stakeholders such as proposers, community advisors and voters.

**Ideal contributor working environment**

What is the ideal contributor working environment for the contributors to work in that will help achieve these goals?

* **High alignment** - The systems that help guide the different users through the core system flow   represent need to be well aligned. Consistency between data models, APIs and integrations used across these steps will help with making a higher quality user experience and also make it easier for contributors to get involved. Strong communication and a highly collaborative environment will be key for a team of contributors to have maximum alignment in how they reach the goals of the ecosystem.
* **Flexible** - The requirements and potential impact of working on each part of the core system will change over time depending on the needs of the ecosystem. Contributors should be able to easily move to the highest priority area to maximise their impact.
* **Skill sharing** - Contributors will be most effective if each individual can use their skills in any of the areas that it would be impactful so they can maximise how effective their contributions can be for the ecosystem.&#x20;
* **Knowledge sharing** - Each contributor will be most useful if knowledge can be shared across the team so contributors are fully informed when making decisions and implementing solutions to the core ecosystem tools.
* **Efficient** - Contributors to the ecosystem will be most impactful when they are spending most of their time solving problems and supporting the community. This means using tools and processes that make them more efficient and reducing factors such as admin tasks that incur wasted or duplicated effort where possible.&#x20;

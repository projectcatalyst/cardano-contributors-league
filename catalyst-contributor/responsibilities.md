# Responsibilities

A cohort of Catalyst contributors should cover the following combined areas of responsibility to support the growth and evolution of the Catalyst ecosystem.



### **Support**&#x20;

Provide support to the community, proposal teams, proposal assessors and voters on any part of the funding process. Contributors should be able to answer questions, create useful education resources, provide technical support and also offer suggestions to those that need help. Contributors should help with translation support where possible and help with the ease of participation for a global audience.



### **Coordinate**

Bring the community together to collaborate on issues and successes within the Catalyst ecosystem. Help bring proposal teams together to bring more alignment and collaboration where possible instead of duplicated efforts. Contributors should allocate effort towards initiatives that make it easier for the community to collaborate most effectively.



### **Govern**

Help the community make decisions collectively about the implementations and processes used in the Catalyst ecosystem. The wider community should be included into any important governance decisions, especially those that may be directly impacted by those decisions such as parameter changes or for deciding where resources are allocated. Contributors will be responsible for bringing together all the information required to better inform those involved in governance decisions so that the voters are better informed on the implications of any given decision. Contributors will also be delegated authority for some areas of the ecosystem where they will be responsible as a cohort to govern and make decisions on these processes or tools effectively as a team.



### Build

Bring together data, analysis and feedback to guide the prioritisation and execution of new processes or developments of new solutions for the ecosystem. Contributors are responsible for supporting the design, implementation and testing of new solutions that help to improve how the Catalyst ecosystem functions. The communities opinions and feedback should be welcomed at any stage and considered when building new solutions. Contributors will be responsible for ensuring quality standards are met and the right resources are in place so that the community is able to easily start using solutions that get introduced.



### **Maintain**

Manage ecosystem parameters, tools and services to ensure the ecosystem is robust and reliable. Keep documentation and resources up to date and widely available. Monitor and moderate tools and processes in the funding process to ensure they are functioning correctly. Contributors should monitor funded proposals to review progress where necessary and ensure progress is being made.

### **Delegate**&#x20;

Catalyst contributors are not expected to be responsible for every form of work that supports the Catalyst ecosystem. Contributors should delegate tasks and efforts towards community members and also support existing projects that help to improve the Catalyst ecosystem. Contributors should try to distribute treasury funding they have accrued to support these initiatives that help the Catalyst ecosystem.

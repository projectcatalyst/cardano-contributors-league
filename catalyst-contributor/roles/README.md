# Roles

Roles provide clarity to contributors and the wider community by letting everyone else know what area the contributor intends to help with when they contribute to improving the Catalyst ecosystem. Voters get clarity when voting as they will know who they want to fill certain roles within the ecosystem.

Contributors select a role to indicate where they will spend the most time supporting the ecosystem. Selecting a role does not mean the contributor can't help in the other areas. It instead simply means they will look to spend the majority of their time in that selected role.

[Budget ranges](budget-ranges.md) and [minimum thresholds](minimum-thresholds.md) are added to guide contributors when creating their proposals. The minimum thresholds help to ensure there's enough of each role and skill set in each contributor cohort.



## Available roles

The following are the initial roles for contributors to select from. Other future considerations are discussed below in the [future potential roles](./#others-areas-to-consider).

**Tasks**

* Conduct ecosystem research and analysis to identify problems and opportunities for improvement
* Collect, aggregate and analyse community feedback and overall sentiment about the ecosystem

* Coordinate efforts towards applying information around research findings, analysis and statistics to the maintenance and improvement of ecosystem systems and processes
* Host discussions and meetings about ecosystem research findings, analysis and statistics
* Provide feedback to proposals that could benefit from considering relevant ecosystem research, analysis and statistics



### **QA & Auditing**

**Objective** - Help with quality assurance testing on changing ecosystem functionality to ensure releases are to a high quality. Support in the development of new processes and reporting so proposal teams can demonstrate their impact. Help the community with support on auditability and with auditing and flagging proposals.

**Tasks**

* Review and flag submitted proposals that require further checks and verification
* Test implementation features prior to release and report on any issues
* Research QA best practices for ecosystem development processes
* Research, analyse and improve auditing approaches so that best practices are being used for different types of proposals
* Write and maintain documentation about the auditing or QA processes used across the ecosystem
* Provide support to the community on how to audit funded proposals and test new ecosystem functionality
* Coordinate community efforts towards how to effectively test and audit within the ecosystem
* Host community discussions about funded proposal auditing and the ecosystem QA process
* Audit and provide feedback to progress reports from funded proposals



### **Marketing**

**Objective** - Reach out to the community, host events and provide support to the marketing efforts across the Catalyst ecosystem. Bring better alignment, data driven results and reporting to highlight evidence of the impact the ecosystem is having and any progress due to community efforts towards improving the Catalyst process.

**Tasks**

* Promote and share the ecosystem with different marketing initiatives
* Conduct proposer outreach to increase the number of quality proposals submitted each funding round
* Aggregate, analyse and report on marketing analytics data and community efforts
* Support the research and creation of marketing resources and creative content
* Write or proofread marketing copy for use in promotion of the ecosystem
* Identify marketing tools, processes and approaches to increase efficiency in performing any ecosystem marketing and outreach efforts
* Write and maintain documentation about events and marketing processes used for ecosystem marketing and outreach
* Provide support on any marketing or outreach efforts needed for relevant areas across the ecosystem
* Coordinate efforts in the ecosystem around the promotion of different ecosystem events, updates and news
* Host discussions and events about the benefits of the ecosystem and recent successes
* Provides feedback to proposals regarding their marketing and outreach plans and efforts



### **Product**

**Objective** - Research, collate and get consensus on the highest priority problems within the ecosystem to then help guide solutions that solve those problems whilst maintaining a high quality user experience. Help contributors come to alignment in how to implement solutions and work with the community to bring in feedback and data to support product direction through both contributor and community led governance.

**Tasks**

* Create and maintain product development workflows that take ideas and problem sensing through to implementation of solutions, outcome tracking and continued iterative improvement
* Conduct research, analyse and report on similar products and ecosystems in the wider market
* Research, analyse and improve the approaches and best practices to use for product development workflows

* Provide feedback to proposals regarding their design and interface plans and efforts



## Potential future roles

The following are other options to consider that could become roles in the future.&#x20;

****

**Education**

Many of the existing roles can support the education of the core ecosystem. Those tasks include writing documentation relevant to what each contributor is working on and also hosting meetings with other contributors and the wider community. Coordination, design, product and marketing roles are well suited for helping create visual education aids to support education. If there is difficulty maintaining ecosystem educational resources a group of full time education contributors could be considered that would solely focus on educational materials, sessions and generally supporting the community.

****

**Human resources**

The role of dealing with who is and isn't a full time contributor will be dealt with by the community governance vote. Initially through general voters and then potentially in the future refined down to engaged community members to make it more scalable and simplify the process. If a contributor does not perform or produces conflict with others they are likely to not secure future funding so managing contributors from a human resources perspective could be fairly self governing. Depending on the issues faced from funding contributors directly in the future a more full time human resource contributor could be considered to resolve and manage these issues. Alternatively this role could end up being achieved under a form of auditing role that is fulfilled by community members at the end of contributor funding terms with the right incentive models in place.



**Finance**

Contributors would be funded directly from the treasury initially in six month terms. This helps makes the initial process need little oversight. However the core ecosystem will have other costs such as server costs or usage of SaaS tools to help the contributors work effectively. Managing these costs could be done through a governance process done by contributors using a shared funding pot. If the complexity of managing a shared funding pot increases over time it will make sense to explore the usage of a finance role so that these concerns become better managed.

# Roles

Roles provide clarity to contributors and the wider community by letting everyone else know what area the contributor intends to help with when they contribute to improving the Catalyst ecosystem. Voters get clarity when voting as they will know who they want to fill certain roles within the ecosystem.

Contributors select a role to indicate where they will spend the most time supporting the ecosystem. Selecting a role does not mean the contributor can't help in the other areas. It instead simply means they will look to spend the majority of their time in that selected role.

[Budget ranges](budget-ranges.md) and [minimum thresholds](minimum-thresholds.md) are added to guide contributors when creating their proposals. The minimum thresholds help to ensure there's enough of each role and skill set in each contributor cohort.



## Available roles

The following are the initial roles for contributors to select from. Other future considerations are discussed below in the [future potential roles](./#others-areas-to-consider).

****

### **Development**

* Run community events and meet ups
* Host topic based collaboration meetings
* Help organise and manage an ecosystem calendar
* Support translations and coordinate with global communities
* Help educate community members about the ecosystem
* Provide general support to community
* Look for skill gaps in the ecosystem that would benefit from more contributors



### **Analysis**

**Objective** - Research and analyse the ecosystem tools and services and produce data points, reports and documentation that help guide the future development of the ecosystem. Help ensure other contributors have the information they need to maximise their impact.

**Tasks**

* Analyse and give feedback to proposals and ecosystem changes
* Conduct ecosystem research, outline problems and conduct analysis
* Collect and aggregate community feedback
* Create, maintain and aggregate ecosystem analytics
* Share statistics and create reports on ecosystem performance
* Audit proposal team plans and execution

* Host meetings on problems, research or findings from analysis
* Write and maintain ecosystem documentation&#x20;



### **QA & Auditing**

**Objective** - Help with quality assurance testing on changing ecosystem functionality to ensure releases are to a high quality. Support in the development of new processes and reporting so proposal teams can demonstrate their impact. Help the community with support on auditability and with auditing and flagging proposals.

**Tasks**

* Research, support and flag proposals that require review
* Help test implementation features prior to release
* Create and document QA process plans
* Research QA best practices for core ecosystem development processes
* Research auditing best practices for different types of proposal
* Review proposal team audit reports for feedback and flagging
* Manage and improve progress audit reporting processes
* Host meetings on QA & auditing process, improvements and results



### **Marketing**

**Objective** - Reach out to the community, host events and provide support to the marketing efforts across the Catalyst ecosystem. Bring better alignment, data driven results and reporting to highlight evidence of the impact the ecosystem is having and any progress due to community efforts towards improving the Catalyst process.

**Tasks**

* Regularly promote and share the ecosystem
* Conduct proposer outreach and try to increase engagement
* Review and provide feedback to proposals around marketing
* Aggregate and report on marketing analytics data
* Support the creation of any design marketing materials
* Support community event organisation and promotion of those events
* Conduct market research and share findings
* Write and proofread marketing copy
* Research and help produce creative content
* Identify marketing tools, processes and approaches to increase efficiency in engaging with and sharing information to the community &#x20;
* Host meetings on marketing approaches, new tools or processes and any recent results



### **Product**

**Objective** - Research, collate and get consensus on the highest priority problems within the ecosystem to then help guide solutions that solve those problems whilst maintaining a high quality user experience. Help contributors come to alignment in how to implement solutions and work with the community to bring in feedback and data to support product direction through both contributor and community led governance.

**Tasks**

* Lead efforts on problem sensing, problem prioritisation, solution research and solution implementation planning
* Engage with contributors and the community to improve the product strategy and roadmap
* Conduct research and analysis on similar products and ecosystems
* Communicate and host discussions regarding any product plans, timelines and releases
* Research, maintain and improve product development workflows
* Draft ecosystem functionality implementation plans
* Research and analyse current industry user experience developments and best practices
* Gather product feedback and analyse results
* Aggregate and report on product analytics data and community feedback
* Host meetings around problem sensing, prioritisation and suggested solution approaches



### **Design**

**Objective** - Design graphics, layouts and optimise user flows to create a high quality user experience for the community. Help contributors with maintaining consistency and alignment of the visual design and user experiences of all the ecosystems tools and services.

**Tasks**

* Create design concepts, graphics and layouts
* Create and maintain style guides, icons and illustrations
* Create wireframes and visualise product user flows
* Gather user feedback and iterate on designs across the ecosystem
* Support research on industry user experience developments and best practices
* Review final layouts and implementations to suggest any improvements
* Create design materials for relevant online and local events
* Support and provide feedback on design to ecosystem projects
* Host design discussion meetings and gather community feedback



## Potential future roles

The following are other options to consider that could become roles in the future.&#x20;

****

**Education**

Many of the existing roles can support the education of the core ecosystem. Those tasks include writing documentation relevant to what each contributor is working on and also hosting meetings with other contributors and the wider community. Coordination, design, product and marketing roles are well suited for helping create visual education aids to support education. If there is difficulty maintaining ecosystem educational resources a group of full time education contributors could be considered that would solely focus on educational materials, sessions and generally supporting the community.

****

**Human resources**

The role of dealing with who is and isn't a full time contributor will be dealt with by the community governance vote. Initially through general voters and then potentially in the future refined down to engaged community members to make it more scalable and simplify the process. If a contributor does not perform or produces conflict with others they are likely to not secure future funding so managing contributors from a human resources perspective could be fairly self governing. Depending on the issues faced from funding contributors directly in the future a more full time human resource contributor could be considered to resolve and manage these issues. Alternatively this role could end up being achieved under a form of auditing role that is fulfilled by community members at the end of contributor funding terms with the right incentive models in place.



**Finance**

Contributors would be funded directly from the treasury initially in six month terms. This helps makes the initial process need little oversight. However the core ecosystem will have other costs such as server costs or usage of SaaS tools to help the contributors work effectively. Managing these costs could be done through a governance process done by contributors using a shared funding pot. If the complexity of managing a shared funding pot increases over time it will make sense to explore the usage of a finance role so that these concerns become better managed.

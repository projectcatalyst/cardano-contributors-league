# Focus Areas

Focus areas provide clarity to contributors on who is working in which area whilst improving the core ecosystem. Voters also get clarity when voting on who they want to fill certain roles within the ecosystem.

Contributors select focus areas to indicate where they will spend the most time supporting the ecosystem. Selecting a focus area does not mean the contributor can't help in the other areas it simply means they will look to spend the majority of their time in their selected focus area.

For a given funding round [minimum thresholds](minimum-thresholds.md) and [budget ranges](budget-ranges.md) are attached to focus areas.

## Selected focus areas

The following are the suggested initial focus areas for contributors to select from, other considerations are discussed in the [future potential focus areas](./#others-areas-to-consider).

## Potential future focus **areas**

The following are options to consider now or in the future as other potential focus areas.&#x20;

****

**Education**

Many of the existing focus areas can support with education around the core ecosystem. Those focus areas include writing documentation relevant to what they are working on and also hosting meetings with other contributors and the wider community. Coordination, design, product and marketing focus areas are also well suited for helping create any visual education aids that benefit the core ecosystem. If the core process requires more education in the future a full time education contributor could be added that would solely focus on educational materials and supporting the community.

****

**Human resources**

The role of dealing with who is and isn't a full time contributor will be dealt with by the community. Initially through general voters and potentially in the future more focussed on just the engaged community members to simplify the process. If a contributor does not perform or produces conflict with others they are likely to not secure future funding so managing contributors from a human resources perspective may not be needed. If contributors received more of a full time role in the future this would be where human resource processes and systems would be needed or a focus area for contributors to dedicate more time to these issues.

****

**Finance**

Contributors would be funded directly from the treasury and in six month term bursts which makes that part of the process need little oversight. The core ecosystem will have other costs such as server costs or using other SaaS tools to help the contributors work more effectively. Managing these costs can be done through voting from contributors with a shared funding pot. If the complexity of this shared funding and need for voting increases over time it will then make sense to explore the usage of a finance focus area where these concerns are better managed.
